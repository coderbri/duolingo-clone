# Dynamic Course Header Rendering

In this section, we want users to see the header of their learn page displaying the name of the course they selected, along with the correct hearts and points in the user progress area. Let's make those changes now.

Go to the Learn Page's **`page.tsx`** in the **`app/(main)/learn/`** route directory. In the `<UserProgress />` component, replace the hardcoded properties with the following:

#### Before

```tsx
<UserProgress
    activeCourse={{ title: "Spanish", imageSrc: "/es-flag.svg" }}
    hearts={5}
    points={100}
    hasActiveSubscription={false}
/>
```

#### After

```tsx
<UserProgress
    activeCourse={userProgress.activeCourse}
    hearts={userProgress.hearts}
    points={userProgress.points}
    hasActiveSubscription={false}
/>
```

For now, we'll leave the "active subscription" attribute alone since it is not set up at this point in the project.

Next, navigate to the **`components/user-progress.tsx`** file in the `components/` directory and update our "TODO" comment for props:

#### Before

```tsx
type Props = {
    activeCourse: { imageSrc: string; title: string}; // TODO: Replace with DB Types
    hearts: number;
    points: number;
    hasActiveSubscription: boolean;
};
```

#### After

```tsx
type Props = {
    activeCourse: typeof courses.$inferSelect;
    hearts: number;
    points: number;
    hasActiveSubscription: boolean;
};
```

This change will add types from Drizzle. To test if this works, we can access a course other than Spanish (as that is hardcoded) and see how the user progress updates accordingly to show the flag and other data.

### Troubleshooting

If errors appear when trying to render a language course:

1. Confirm that `typeof courses` is properly set up in the props of **`components/user-progress.tsx`**.
2. Ensure that the `src={imageSrc}` attribute in the Image tag matches that in `schema.ts`, where `imageSrc` is tied to the `userProgress` table and the `activeCourse`.

### Updating the Learn Page's Header

Go back to the Learn Page's `page.tsx`, search for the `<Header />` component, and change the title as follows:

#### `learn/page.tsx`

```tsx
<Header title={userProgress.activeCourse.title} />
```

Now, accessing the course should display the relevant information we stored about the course in the database.
